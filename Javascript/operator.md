# Operators

A symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result.
*Operator usually represents an action or process*

## Types of operators. 

1. Assignment operators
2. Comparison operators
3. Arithmetic operators
4. Bitwise operators
5. Logical operators
6. String operators
7. Conditional (ternary) operator
8. Comma operator
9. Unary operators
10. Relational operators


### Assignment Operators
- The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
- var x = 1 ; //assign value 1 to variable x

### Comparison Operators
- Equal to ( == ) 
- equal value and equal type ( === )
- not Equal( != ) 
- not equal value or not equal type( !== )
- greater than( > )
- less than ( < )
- greater than or equal to ( >= )
- less than or equal to( <= )

### Arithmetic Operators
- Addition Operator( + )
- Subtraction Operator( - )
- Division Operator ( / )
- Multiplication Operator ( * )
- Remainder Operator ( % )
- Exponential Operator ( ** )

### Bitwise Operator
- Bitwise AND ( & )
- Bitwise OR ( | )
- Bitwise XOR ( ^ )
- Bitwise NOT ( ~ )
- Zero fill left shift ( << )
- Signed right shift ( >> )
- Zero fill right shift ( >>> )

### Logical Operator
- Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
- AND ( && ) 
- OR ( || )
- NOT ( ! )

### String Operator
- used to concatenate (add) strings.
- Addition Sign ( + )
- Addition assignment ( += )


### Conditional( Ternary Operator ) 
- Ternary operator ( ? )
    - condition ? val1 : val2


### Comma Operator
- comma operator (,)

### Unary Operator
- A unary operation is an operation with only one operand.
- delete
    - The delete operator deletes an object's property. 
- typeof
    - typeof operand
    - operand is the string, variable, keyword, or object for which the type is to be returned.
    -it return the type of operand
- void 
    - The void operator specifies an expression to be evaluated without returning a value.
    - void expression

### Relational operators
- A relational operator compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true.

- in
    - The in operator returns true if the specified property is in the specified object. 
    - The syntax is:
        - obj in objectName

- instanceof
    - The instanceof operator returns true if the specified object is of the specified object type. 
    - The syntax is:
        - objectName instanceof objectType
