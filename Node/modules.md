# Modular Programming

Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.

# Node.js Module

    A set of functions you want to include in your application.

# Built-in Modules

    - Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
    - such as:- buffer , fs , http , net , os ,path , vm , v8, url etc.

# Include Modules

    - To include a module, we use the require() function with the name of the module
    - To define your own modules, you need to define their path.
    - Example :
        -> var fs = require('fs');
        -> var date= require('./date');

# Creating your own module

    1. Create two files
