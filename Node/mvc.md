# MVC (Model, View, and Controller)

- MVC stands for Model, View, and Controller. MVC separates an application into three components - Model, View, and Controller.
- In MVC pattern, application and its development are divided into three interconnected parts. The advantage of this is it helps in focusing on a specific part of the application name, the ways information is presented to and accepted from, the user.

### Model

- Model represents the shape of the data.
- Essentially, it is the database part of the application.

### View

- View in MVC is a user interface. View display model data to the user and also enables them to modify them.

### Controller

- Controller is request-response handler.
- The controller handles the user request. Typically, the user uses the view and raises an HTTP request, which will be handled by the controller. The controller processes the request and returns the appropriate view as a response.
