# Database

- A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated. Computer databases typically contain aggregations of data records or files, containing information about sales transactions or interactions with specific customers.

### SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is the language used to query RDBMS, including inserting, updating, deleting, and searching records. Relational databases work on each table that has a key field that uniquely indicates each row. These key fields can be used to connect one table of data to another.

### Types of databases

- Hierarchical databases
  - In a hierarchical database management system (hierarchical DBMSs) model ,data is stored in a parent-children relationship node
- Network databases
  - Network databases are hierarchical databases, but unlike hierarchical databases where one node can have a single parent only, a network node can have a relationship with multiple entities.
- Relational databases
  - In a relational database management systems (RDBMS), the relationship between data is relational and data is stored in tabular form of columns and rows
- Object-oriented databases
  - Object-oriented modeling (OOM) is the construction of objects using a collection of objects that contain stored values of the instance variables found within an object.
- Graph databases
  - Graph Databases are NoSQL databases and use a graph structure for semantic queries. The data is stored in the form of nodes, edges, and properties
- ER model databases
  - Entity Relationship Model(ER Modeling) is a graphical approach to database design
- Document databases
  - Document databases (Document DB) are also NoSQL database that store data in the form of documents. Each document represents the data, its relationship between other data elements, and attributes of data. Document database store data in a key value form.
- NoSQL databases
  - NoSQL databases are the databases that do not use SQL as their primary data access language. Graph database, network database, object database, and document databases are common NoSQL databases.
  - NoSQL database does not have predefined schemas, which makes NoSQL databases a perfect candidate for rapidly changing development environments.

### NoSQL

- NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

### Here is a list of 10 popular NoSQL databases:

- MongoDB, CouchBase
- Cosmos DB
- ArangoDB
- Couchbase Server
- CouchDB
- Amazon DocumentDB
- Elasticsearch
- Informix
- SAP HANA
- Neo4j

### MongoDB

- MongoDB is an open-source document database and leading NoSQL database. MongoDB is written in C++
- MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.
