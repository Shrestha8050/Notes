# Function

_A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task._
JavaScript functions are used to perform operations.A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it). We can call JavaScript function many times to reuse the code.

### Syntax of Function

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

        //Function Initialization
        function name(p1,p2){
            //executing code
        }

        //Function call
        name('Mark','Shrestha')
