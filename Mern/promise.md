# Promise

Promise is an object which represent future result value.
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of anasynchronous operation (operation that takes time ) and its resulting value.

In promise, asynchronous methods doesnot return the value directly butit returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.

### A Promise is in one of these states:

        1. pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
        2. fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
        3. rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
